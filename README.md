# EC2 CloudFormation Deployment

The EC2 CloudFormation Deployment project simplifies the provisioning and management of Amazon EC2 instances using AWS CloudFormation. This repository contains templates and configurations to facilitate the automated deployment of EC2 instances along with associated resources in an efficient and consistent manner.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
    - An AWS account with necessary permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and EC2 instances.
    - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with appropriate credentials.

### Deployment

## Usage
Once the CloudFormation stack is successfully deployed, you can interact with the provisioned EC2 instances using SSH, remote desktop, or any other appropriate method. Reference the instance IDs and security groups defined in your CloudFormation template.

## Configuration
The `instanceTemplate.yaml` CloudFormation template offers various configuration options for EC2 instances, instance types, security groups, and networking. Adjust these parameters according to your project's requirements.
